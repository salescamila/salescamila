I'm a software engineer with a desktop and relational database development background who started studying front-end development and React.Js in early 2019 as a way to keep up with technology.

Working with programming since 2011, I developed in different programming languages as needed (C, C++, C#, Java, PHP, SQL, Pascal with Delphi 5, Javascript and ABAP for ERP/SAP) and also became familiar with the analysis process, requirements gathering, documentation, development, testing and post-implementation monitoring.
